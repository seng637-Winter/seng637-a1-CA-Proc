# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In order to create a useful exploratory testing plan, first we reviewed the requirements document contained within Appendix B. This review identified a number of system behaviours and constraints that the software must meet. Once we identified these behaviours and constraints, we used them to generate use-cases which would model the end user behaviour. Our exploratory testing plan was not designed to be fully exhaustive, however we did design it to include at least two tests for every major system behavior listed in the requirements document, one positive test (normal behaviour expected to function normally), and one negative test where possible(abnormal behaviour expected to fail). We also included additional test cases for any specific constraints outlined within the requirements document (eg. only dispensing $20 bills). When a specific behaviour could have multiple options such as transferring money between a selection of accounts, we only decided to test one combination to test the underlying functionality, rather than the specific combination of accounts. This is an area that could be investigated further during scripted or exhaustive testing. 

We felt that this plan structure would allow us to give a wide range of attention to the overall performance of the system, and give insight into any areas which would warrant further attention if necessary for a more in-depth series of tests.

A list of the identified behaviours, the associated positive and negative tests, and any additional test cases are listed below.

| Behaviour | Positive Test Case | Negative Test Case | 
| ----------| -------------------| -------------------| 
| User inserts card | Valid Card number | Invalid Card Number | 
| User enters pin | Valid pin for valid card | Invalid pin for valid card |
| Cash withdrawal | Amount less than in account | Amount more than in account | 
| Transfer Money  | Amount less than in account 1 | Amount more than in account 1|
| Balance Inquiry | Account listed on the display | Invalid account |
| Cancel transaction | Cancel during valid transaction | N/A |
| Operator switch | Toggled while no customer present | Toggled while customer is present | 


| Additional test cases | 
| ----------------------|
| Withdrawal of amount not in denominations of $20 |
| Pin retry, incorrect pin, followed by correct pin | 
| Retain card, three incorrect pin tries | 
| Examine log entries, complete, no pin #s |

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
